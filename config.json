            "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThe Elrond Launchpad contract _LaunchStage_ selection relies on the `get_launch_stage` function which returns the current stage:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/akiratechhq/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L379-L380\r\n\r\nThis function is used to restrict actions only to specific stages:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/akiratechhq/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L292-L294\r\n\r\nThe logic determines the current stage dynamically, based on the value of multiple state variables:\r\n\r\n- `self.nr_winning_tickets()`\r\n- `self.total_confirmed_tickets()`\r\n- `self.claim_start_epoch()`\r\n- `self.winner_selection_start_epoch()`\r\n- `self.current_generation()`\r\n- `self.confirmation_period_start_epoch()`\r\n- `self.confirmation_period_in_epochs()`\r\n\r\nSome of these variables can be changed by the owner at will (with some limitations). \r\n\r\nThe issue is that the logic that determines the current stage makes use of dynamic variables that can be and are changed during the lifecycle of this contract:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/akiratechhq/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L383-L397\r\n\r\nCompared to an explicit logic whereby the owner can manage the stage transitions manually (and the contract code validates that each transition is valid), the current version of the code is more prone to errors. An invalid state transition (see #5) was already found but was difficult to spot because of the way the `get_launch_stage` function uses dynamic variables that can be changed in other parts of the contract.\r\n\r\nThe documentation features a state diagram that outlines the transition flow of stages:\r\n\r\n![flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/342638/137272192-e44aea16-6a4e-4362-8129-fd61a9c0a806.png)\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of how this flow chart does not necessarily represent what the code can do:\r\n\r\n1. Current stage is `ConfirmTickets` (ie. `confirmation_period_start_epoch < current_epoch < confiration_period_end_epoch`)\r\n1. Owner updates the following state variables so that `current_epoch < winner_selection_start_epoch`: `winner_selection_start_epoch`, `confirmation_period_start_epoch`\r\n1. Current stage is `AddTickets` - the code allowed the owner to perform a transition from ConfirmTickets to AddTickets which is not reflected in the flowchart\r\n1. Further on, this invalid transition can pose a risk since adding more tickets in its current state might expose other issues\r\n\r\n**Recommendation**\r\n\r\nWe prefer a more explicit way of managing the state. If resources allow we recommend rewriting the `get_launch_stage` function to allow the owner to set the current stage and only do sanity checks to ensure that the state transition is valid.\r\n",

Therefore `get_launch_stage` will return `LaunchStage::Claim`: \r\nhttps://github.com/akiratechhq/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L385-L389\r\n\r\n2. The owner calls the` refundConfirmedTickets` function to refund a ticket of an already blacklisted address. This will decrement the `total_confirmed_tickets` value by the number of refunded tickets: \r\nhttps://github.com/akiratechhq/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L91-L92\r\n\r\n3. Now `get_launch_stage` will return `LaunchStage::SelectNewWinners` since the condition `total_confirmed_tickets <= total_winning_tickets` evaluates to `false` and all the other conditions in the function are not met: \r\nhttps://github.com/akiratechhq/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L413-L416\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because once the stage reaches `Claim` it should not change back to another stage. Additionally, for the owner of the contract, this transition is not at all obvious and causes issues for the users trying to claim their tickets.\r\n",

The method `shuffle_single_ticket` is called to pick a random ticket and place it in the current position.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L136-L143\r\n\r\nAfter each swap, the position is incremented by 1.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L136-L143\r\n\r\nThe method `shuffle_single_ticket` picks a random ticket and places it in the current position (`current_ticket_position`).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L438-L446\r\n\r\nThis part selects a number between `current_ticket_position + 1` and `last_ticket_position` inclusive.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L447-L448\r\n\r\nThe Fisher-Yates algorithm states that you should pick a number between the current position and the last position. The current position should be included in the selection range.\r\n\r\nWikipedia describes a variation of this algorithm, named [Sattolo's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Sattolo's_algorithm).\r\n\r\n> A very similar algorithm was published in 1986 by Sandra Sattolo for generating uniformly distributed cycles of (maximal) length n.[6][7] The only difference between Durstenfeld's and Sattolo's algorithms is that in the latter, in step 2 above, the random number j is chosen from the range between 1 and i\u22121 (rather than between 1 and i) inclusive. This simple change modifies the algorithm so that the resulting permutation always consists of a single cycle.\r\n\r\nThe current code actually implements the Sattolo's algorithm because it selects items to swap from the `current_ticket_position + 1` instead of `current_ticket_position`.\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia page warns this can be easy to accidentally implement.\r\n\r\n> In fact, as described below, it is quite easy to accidentally implement Sattolo's algorithm when the ordinary Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle is intended. This will bias the results by causing the permutations to be picked from the smaller set of (n\u22121)! cycles of length N, instead of from the full set of all n! possible permutations.\r\n\r\nTechnically the current code version implements Sattolo's algorithm instead of Fisher-Yates which is mentioned in the comments.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L438-L440\r\n\r\n**Recommendation**\r\n\r\nChange the selection interval to include the `current_ticket_position` when selecting a random number.\r\n\r\nThis code should use `current_ticket_position` instead of `current_ticket_position + 1`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/monoceros-alpha/review-elrond-launchpad-2021-10/blob/a32fe0b2ef7430e9b86d6b22da60b697f8eaac3c/code/launchpad/src/launchpad.rs#L447-L448\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n- [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)\r\n- [Sattolo's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#Sattolo's_algorithm)",
