## Scope

The initial review focused on the [Elrond Launchpad](git@github.com:ElrondNetwork/sc-launchpad-rs.git) repository, identified by the commit hash `f0bf99cafcee468a0e4c3aaa74f22df04f1c82b3`. ...

<!-- We focused on manually reviewing the codebase, searching for security issues such as, but not limited to, re-entrancy problems, transaction ordering, block timestamp dependency, exception handling, call stack depth limitation, integer overflow/underflow, self-destructible contracts, unsecured balance, use of origin, costly gas patterns, architectural problems, code readability. -->

**Includes:**
- GoodContract.sol

**Excludes:**
- BadContract.sol

## Recommendations

We identified a few possible general improvements that are not security issues during the review, which will bring value to the developers and the community reviewing and using the product.

<!-- ### Increase the number of tests

A good rule of thumb is to have 100% test coverage. This does not guarantee the lack of security problems, but it means that the desired functionality behaves as intended. The negative tests also bring a lot of value because not allowing some actions to happen is also part of the desired behavior.
